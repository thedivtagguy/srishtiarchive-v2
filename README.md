# Contributing

Something wrong on the website? Something looking ugly that doesn't need to be? A new feature that could be added? Everything can be modified, just submit a pull request and I'll merge it with them master if the changes make sense and there are no conflicts. There is a centralized project database on Contentful and you will have to email me asking for access. While contributing technical changes please: 

1. Deploy your fork to your own Netlify account.
2. Maintain a list of changes that you have made.
