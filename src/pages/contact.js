        <span class="highlight-border rounded-md px-2 py-1">Srishti Archive is an open-source, collaborative design project</span>, we'd love your help. Treat the proposal like ordering at McDonald's, it's better if you decide what you want before you end up at the counter. If you're writing to collaborate, please mention what you'll be contributing and how you can help. For example, do the buttons look stupid to you? Share a better design and I'll try to code it in.<br></br> <br></br> For technical contributions, check out the <a href="https://github.com/thedivtagguy/srishtiarchive-v2/"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="bg-accent-gray text-light-gray highlight-border px-2 py-1 rounded-md"> ðŸ”— Github repository</span></a> and see if the source makes sense. Submit a pull request and we'll merge it if it is useful.
